# Smartdarts: Automated Dart Scoring With Computer Vision on Portable Camera
## About Repo 
This repository contains the Project code, dataset, and documentation.
## Project Information
This Project investigates the interaction between a portable dartboard and natural lighting conditions. Computer vision technology is used in this work to extract features from images taken from various angles using portable mobile and natural lighting situations and provide new insights into the location of the stationary dartboard.

## Project Workflow

## Dataset
An iPhone 15 Pro Max camera was set up to take pictures at normal distances and angles of 45 and 60 degrees for the dartboard's plane. The dataset consists of 240 photos altogether; 30 images from each angle were gathered. A picture (b) of this collection shows a representative sample, giving an idea of the range and depth of the collected data.
